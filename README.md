# nodejs-data-structures
Javascript implementation of data structures for educational purposes.

## Lists
* ArrayList - implemented.
** It is understood that the Javascript language array construct behaves like an ArrayList and thus invalidates the need for an ArrayList implementation, but again the purpose of this implementation is to demonstrate underlying behaviors of a dynamic array.
* LinkedList - not implemented.
** Implys singly linked list.
* DoubleLinkedList - not implemented.
* Stack - not implemented.
* Queue - not implemented.
* CircularQueue - not implemented.
